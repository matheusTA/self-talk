# Self-Talk

Practicing conversation is essential for mastering any language, but finding opportunities to practice can be challenging. Language barriers can limit access to valuable content and international opportunities.

## Project Goal

Our app aims to create an accessible and free platform where anyone can improve their conversation skills in various languages. Using advanced artificial intelligence technology, we provide a safe and interactive environment to practice real conversations through voice chat. The goal is to help users gain confidence, fluency, and stand out in an increasingly globalized world.

By enabling people from all over the world to practice and refine their communication skills, our project seeks to open doors to new academic, professional, and cultural opportunities. Join us and help build bridges through language!
